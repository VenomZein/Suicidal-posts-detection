In the file, I have curated a collection of models trained on a dataset comprising social media posts related to suicide. The primary objective of these models is to detect signs of depression or the likelihood of suicide attempts based on the textual content of the posts.

The repository includes implementations of three distinct deep learning architectures: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Each model is designed to analyze the sequential nature of social media posts and extract meaningful patterns indicative of mental health concerns.
